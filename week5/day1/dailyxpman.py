# 🌟 Exercise 1: Cats

# Instructions

# Using this class

# class Cat:
#     def __init__(self, cat_name, cat_age):
#         self.name = cat_name
#         self.age = cat_age
# Instantiate three Cat objects using the code provided above.
# Outside of the class, create a function that finds the oldest cat and returns the cat.
# Print the following string: “The oldest cat is <cat_name>, and is <cat_age> years old.”. Use the function previously created.


class Cat:
    def __init__(self, cat_name, cat_age):
        self.name = cat_name
        self.age = cat_age


cat1 = Cat("Mittens", 3)
cat2 = Cat("Fluffy", 5)
cat3 = Cat("Benben", 2)

list_of_cats = [cat1, cat2, cat3]


def oldest_cat(list_of_cats):
    oldest_cat = list_of_cats[0]
    for cat in list_of_cats:
        if cat.age > oldest_cat.age:
            oldest_cat = cat
    return oldest_cat


print(
    f"The oldest cat is {oldest_cat(list_of_cats).name}, and is {oldest_cat(list_of_cats).age} years old."
)


# 🌟 Exercise 2 : Dogs

# Instructions

# Create a class called Dog.
# In this class, create an __init__ method that takes two parameters : name and height. This function instantiates two attributes, which values are the parameters.
# Create a method called bark that prints the following string “<dog_name> goes woof!”.
# Create a method called jump that prints the following string “<dog_name> jumps <x> cm high!”. x is the height*2.
# Outside of the class, create an object called davids_dog. His dog’s name is “Rex” and his height is 50cm.
# Print the details of his dog (ie. name and height) and call the methods bark and jump.
# Create an object called sarahs_dog. Her dog’s name is “Teacup” and his height is 20cm.
# Print the details of her dog (ie. name and height) and call the methods bark and jump.
# Create an if statement outside of the class to check which dog is bigger. Print the name of the bigger dog.


class Dog:
    def __init__(self, name, height):
        self.name = name
        self.height = height

    def bark(self):
        print(f"{self.name} goes woof!")

    def jump(self):
        print(f"{self.name} jumps {self.height * 2} cm high!")


davids_dog = Dog("Rex", 50)

print(davids_dog.name, davids_dog.height)

davids_dog.bark()
davids_dog.jump()

sarah_dog = Dog("Teacup", 20)

print(sarah_dog.name, sarah_dog.height)

sarah_dog.bark()
sarah_dog.jump()

list_of_dogs = [davids_dog, sarah_dog]


def bigger_dog(list_of_dogs):
    bigger_dog = list_of_dogs[0]
    for dog in list_of_dogs:
        if dog.height > bigger_dog.height:
            bigger_dog = dog
    return bigger_dog


print(f"Bigger dog is {bigger_dog(list_of_dogs).name}")

print("_______________")

print(davids_dog.name, davids_dog.height, davids_dog.bark(), davids_dog.jump())


# 🌟 Exercise 3 : Who’s The Song Producer?

# Instructions

# Define a class called Song, it will show the lyrics of a song.
# Its __init__() method should have two arguments: self and lyrics (a list).
# Inside your class create a method called sing_me_a_song that prints each element of lyrics on its own line.
# Create an object, for example:

# stairway= Song(["There’s a lady who's sure","all that glitters is gold", "and she’s buying a stairway to heaven"])


# Then, call the sing_me_a_song method. The output should be:

# There’s a lady who's sure
# all that glitters is gold
# and she’s buying a stairway to heaven


class Song:
    def __init__(self, lyrics):
        self.lyrics = lyrics

    def sing_me_a_song(self):
        for block in self.lyrics:
            print(block)


stairway = Song(
    [
        "There’s a lady who's sure",
        "all that glitters is gold",
        "and she’s buying a stairway to heaven",
    ]
)

stairway.sing_me_a_song()


# Exercise 4 : Afternoon At The Zoo

# Instructions

# Create a class called Zoo.
# In this class create a method __init__ that takes one parameter: zoo_name.
# It instantiates two attributes: animals (an empty list) and name (name of the zoo).
# Create a method called add_animal that takes one parameter new_animal. This method adds the new_animal to the animals list as long as it isn’t already in the list.
# Create a method called get_animals that prints all the animals of the zoo.
# Create a method called sell_animal that takes one parameter animal_sold. This method removes the animal from the list and of course the animal needs to exist in the list.
# Create a method called sort_animals that sorts the animals alphabetically and groups them together based on their first letter.
# Example

# {
#     1: "Ape",
#     2: ["Baboon", "Bear"],
#     3: ['Cat', 'Cougar'],
#     4: ['Eel', 'Emu']
# }


# Create a method called get_groups that prints the animal/animals inside each group.

# Create an object called ramat_gan_safari and call all the methods.
# Tip: The zookeeper is the one who will use this class.
# Example
# Which animal should we add to the zoo --> Giraffe
# x.add_animal(Giraffe)
