# Exercise 4 : Afternoon At The Zoo

# Instructions

# Create a class called Zoo.
# In this class create a method __init__ that takes one parameter: zoo_name.
# It instantiates two attributes: animals (an empty list) and name (name of the zoo).
# Create a method called add_animal that takes one parameter new_animal. This method adds the new_animal to the animals list as long as it isnâ€™t already in the list.
# Create a method called get_animals that prints all the animals of the zoo.
# Create a method called sell_animal that takes one parameter animal_sold. This method removes the animal from the list and of course the animal needs to exist in the list.
# Create a method called sort_animals that sorts the animals alphabetically and groups them together based on their first letter.
# Example

# {
#     1: "Ape",
#     2: ["Baboon", "Bear"],
#     3: ['Cat', 'Cougar'],
#     4: ['Eel', 'Emu']
# }


# Create a method called get_groups that prints the animal/animals inside each group.

# Create an object called ramat_gan_safari and call all the methods.
# Tip: The zookeeper is the one who will use this class.
# Example
# Which animal should we add to the zoo --> Giraffe
# x.add_animal(Giraffe)


class Zoo:
    def __init__(self, name, animals):
        self.name = name
        self.animals = animals

    def add_animal(self, animal):
        while animal != self.animals:
            self.animals.append()

    def get_animal(self):
        print(self.animals)

    def sell_animal(self):
        self.animals.remove(self.animals)
        print(f"{self.animals} has been sold")

    def sort_animals(self):
        self.animals.sort()  # sort the list
