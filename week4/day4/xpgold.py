# üåü Exercise 1 : When Will I Retire ?

# Instructions

# The point of the exercise is to check if a person can retire depending on their age and their gender.
# Note : Retirement age in Israel is 67 for men, and 62 for women (born after April, 1947).

# Create a function get_age(year, month, day)
# Hard-code the current year and month in your code (there are better ways of doing this, but for now it will be enough.)
# After calculating the age of a person, the function should return the age (the age is an integer).
# Create a function can_retire(gender, date_of_birth).
# It should call the get_age function (with what arguments?) in order to receive an age.
# Now it has all the information it needs in order to determine if the person with the given gender and date of birth is able to retire or not.
# Calculate. You may need to do a little more hard-coding here.
# Return True if the person can retire, and False if he/she can‚Äôt.
# Some Hints

# Ask for the user‚Äôs gender as ‚Äúm‚Äù or ‚Äúf‚Äù.
# Ask for the user‚Äôs date of birth in the form of ‚Äúyyyy/mm/dd‚Äù, eg. ‚Äú1993/09/21‚Äù.
# Call can_retire to get a definite value for whether the person can or can‚Äôt retire.
# Display a message informing the user whether they can retire or not.
# As always, test your code to ensure it works.

input_gender = input("Enter Gender (m/f): ")
input_DOB = input("Enter DOB (dd/mm/yyyy): ")


def get_age(year, month, day):
    import datetime

    now = datetime.datetime.now()
    age = now.year - year
    if now.month < month:
        age -= 1
    elif now.month == month and now.day < day:
        age -= 1
    return age


def can_retire(gender, dob):
    yr_mon_day = dob.split("/")
    age = get_age(int(yr_mon_day[0]), int(yr_mon_day[1]), int(yr_mon_day[2]))
    if gender == "m" and age >= 67:
        return True
    elif gender == "f" and age >= 62:
        return True
    else:
        return False


if can_retire(input_gender, input_DOB) == True:
    print("You can retire")
else:
    print("You can't retire")


# üåü Exercise 2 : Sum

# Instructions

# Write a function that accepts one parameter (an int: X) and returns the value of X+XX+XXX+XXXX.
# Example:
# If X=3, the output when calling our function should be 3702 (3 + 33 + 333 + 3333)

# Hint: treating our number as a int or a str at different points in our code may be helpful


# üåü Exercise 3 : Double Dice

# Instructions

# Create a function that will simulate the rolling of a dice. Call it throw_dice. It should return an integer between 1 and 6.
# Create a function called throw_until_doubles.
# It should keep throwing 2 dice (using your throw_dice function) until they both land on the same number, ie. until we reach doubles.
# For example: (1, 2), (3, 1), (5,5) ‚Üí then stop throwing, because doubles were reached.
# This function should return the number of times it threw the dice in total. In the example above, it should return 3.

# Create a main function.
# It should throw doubles 100 times (ie. call your throw_until_doubles function 100 times), and store the results of those function calls (in other words, how many throws it took until doubles were thrown, each time) in a collection. (What kind of collection? Read below to understand what we will need the data for, and this should help you decide which data structure to use).

# After the 100 doubles are thrown, print out a message telling the user how many throws it took in total to reach 100 doubles.
# Also print out a message telling the user the average amount of throws it took to reach doubles. Round this off to 2 decimal places.
# For example:

# If the results of the throws were as follows (your code would do 100 doubles, not just 3):
# (1, 2), (3, 1), (5, 5)
# (3, 3)
# (2, 4), (1, 2), (3, 4), (2, 2)

# Then my output would show something like this:
# Total throws: 8
# Average throws to reach doubles: 2.67.
