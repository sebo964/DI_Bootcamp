# 🌟 Exercise 1 : What Are You Learning ?

# Instructions

# Write a function called display_message() that prints one sentence telling everyone what you are learning in this course.
# Call the function, and make sure the message displays correctly.


# 🌟 Exercise 2: What’s Your Favorite Book ?

# Instructions

# Write a function called favorite_book() that accepts one parameter called title.
# The function should print a message, such as "One of my favorite books is <title>".
# For example: “One of my favorite books is Alice in Wonderland”
# Call the function, make sure to include a book title as an argument when calling the function.


# 🌟 Exercise 3 : Some Geography

# Instructions

# Write a function called describe_city() that accepts the name of a city and its country as parameters.
# The function should print a simple sentence, such as "<city> is in <country>".
# For example “Reykjavik is in Iceland”
# Give the country parameter a default value.
# Call your function.


# Exercise 4 : Random

# Instructions

# Create a function that accepts a number between 1 and 100 and generates another number randomly between 1 and 100.
# Compare the two numbers, if it’s the same number, display a success message, otherwise show a fail message and display both numbers.


# 🌟 Exercise 5 : Let’s Create Some Personalized Shirts !

# Instructions

# Write a function called make_shirt() that accepts a size and the text of a message that should be printed on the shirt.
# The function should print a sentence summarizing the size of the shirt and the message printed on it, such as "The size of the shirt is <size> and the text is <text>"
# Call the function make_shirt().

# Modify the make_shirt() function so that shirts are large by default with a message that reads “I love Python” by default.
# Make a large shirt with the default message
# Make medium shirt with the default message
# Make a shirt of any size with a different message.

# Bonus: Call the function make_shirt() using keyword arguments.


# 🌟 Exercise 6 : Magicians …

# Instructions

# Using this list of magician’s names. magician_names = ['Harry Houdini', 'David Blaine', 'Criss Angel']
# Pass the list to a function called show_magicians(), which prints the name of each magician in the list.
# Write a function called make_great() that modifies the list of magicians by adding the phrase "the Great" to each magician’s name.
# Call the function make_great().
# Call the function show_magicians() to see that the list has actually been modified.


# 🌟 Exercise 7 : Temperature Advice

# Instructions

# Create a function called get_random_temp().
# This function should return an integer between -10 and 40 degrees (Celsius), selected at random.
# Test your function to make sure it generates expected results.

# Create a function called main().
# Inside this function, call get_random_temp() to get a temperature, and store its value in a variable.
# Inform the user of the temperature in a friendly message, eg. “The temperature right now is 32 degrees Celsius.”

# Let’s add more functionality to the main() function. Write some friendly advice relating to the temperature:
# below zero (eg. “Brrr, that’s freezing! Wear some extra layers today”)
# between zero and 16 (eg. “Quite chilly! Don’t forget your coat”)
# between 16 and 23
# between 24 and 32
# between 32 and 40

# Change the get_random_temp() function:
# Add a parameter to the function, named ‘season’.
# Inside the function, instead of simply generating a random number between -10 and 40, set lower and upper limits based on the season, eg. if season is ‘winter’, temperatures should only fall between -10 and 16.
# Now that we’ve changed get_random_temp(), let’s change the main() function:
# Before calling get_random_temp(), we will need to decide on a season, so that we can call the function correctly. Ask the user to type in a season - ‘summer’, ‘autumn’ (you can use ‘fall’ if you prefer), ‘winter’, or ‘spring’.
# Use the season as an argument when calling get_random_temp().

# Bonus: Give the temperature as a floating-point number instead of an integer.
# Bonus: Instead of asking for the season, ask the user for the number of the month (1 = January, 12 = December). Determine the season according to the month.
