# Instructions

# The computer choose a random word and mark stars for each letter of each word.
# Then the player will guess a letter.
# If that letter is in the word(s) then the computer fills the letter in all the correct positions of the word.
# If the letter isn’t in the word(s) then add a body part to the gallows (head, body, left arm, right arm, left leg, right leg).
# The player will continue guessing letters until they can either solve the word(s) (or phrase) or all six body parts are on the gallows.
# The player can’t guess the same letter twice.


# Starter Code

# Here is a piece of code that will give you a random word.

#     import random

#     wordslist = ['correction', 'childish', 'beach', 'python', 'assertive', 'interference', 'complete', 'share', 'credit card', 'rush', 'south']
#     word = random.choice(wordslist)

#     ### YOUR CODE STARTS FROM HERE ###
